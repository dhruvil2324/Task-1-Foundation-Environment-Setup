# Cybersecurity Basics

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. The goal is to ensure that information remains secure, accurate, and accessible only to authorized users.

## 1. CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents the three fundamental principles of cybersecurity:

### 🔐 Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals.

**Examples:**
- Password protection
- Data encryption
- Access control mechanisms

If confidentiality is compromised, private data such as passwords, financial information, or personal records may be exposed.

---

### 🛡 Integrity
Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered unless modified by authorized users.

**Examples:**
- Hashing algorithms (SHA256)
- Digital signatures
- File integrity monitoring

If integrity is compromised, attackers may modify important data such as exam results, financial transactions, or system configurations.

---

### ⚡ Availability
Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.

**Examples:**
- Backup systems
- Redundant servers
- Protection against DDoS attacks

If availability is compromised, systems or websites may become unavailable.

## 2. Threat Types

Cyber threats are malicious activities designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.

### 🎣 Phishing
A social engineering attack where fake emails or websites are used to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

### 🦠 Malware
Malicious software such as viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware designed to damage or control systems.

### 🌐 DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
An attack that floods a server with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

### 💉 SQL Injection
A web attack where malicious SQL queries are inserted into input fields to access or manipulate databases.

### 🔑 Brute Force Attack
An attack that attempts multiple password combinations until the correct one is found.

### 🔒 Ransomware
Malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands payment for decryption.

## 3. Attack Vectors

An attack vector is the method or pathway an attacker uses to gain unauthorized access to a system.

### 🧠 Social Engineering
Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information.

### 📶 Wireless Attacks
Attacks targeting WiFi networks, such as unauthorized access or packet interception.

### 👤 Insider Threats
Threats caused by employees or authorized users misusing their access privileges.
